# THE CASTOR LIBRARY

The objective of the **castor** library is to propose **high-level semantics**, inspired by the Matlab language, allowing fast software prototyping in a low-level compiled language. It is nothing more than a matrix management layer using the tools of the **standard C++ library**, in different storage formats (full, sparse and hierarchical). Indeed, the use of IDEs 1 such as Xcode, Visual studio, Eclipse, etc. allows today to execute compiled code (C, C++, fortran, etc.) with the same **flexibility as interpreted languages** (Matlab, Python, Julia, etc.).
